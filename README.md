# DNS Query Analysis Tool

A lightweight and educational DNS query tool built in GO that demonstrates the inner workings of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol. This tool provides a hands-on way to understand how DNS queries are constructed, sent, and parsed at a low level, without relying on high-level DNS libraries.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this tool is to illuminate the fundamental mechanics of DNS resolution by implementing the protocol from scratch. While production systems typically use established DNS libraries, this tool deliberately works at a lower level to demonstrate:

- The structure and encoding of DNS messages
- The binary formatting of DNS headers and questions
- The process of sending UDP packets to DNS servers
- The parsing and interpretation of DNS responses
- The handling of DNS answer records
